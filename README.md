# Refresh All Tabs Extension

This browser extension hard-refreshes all tabs on the window that the button is clicked.

No frills, no quirks, no secrets. Just click, and refresh. Works on Chrome, FireFox, and Edge!

If you need to do anything more than that, then probably this extension isn't for you :)

As of June 2024, I have added a simple "click counter" to track usages. I scrubbed all headers and cookie informations, so the `fetch` request is simply a "clean hit" to my endpoint that adds 1 to my counter.
